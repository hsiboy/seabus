AppNeta TraceView instrumentation libraries for Python
=====================================================

The 'oboe' and 'oboeware' modules provide support for instrumenting
programs for use with the Tracelytics Oboe instrumentation library.

The oboe module provides a Pythonic interface to liboboe for C, and
the oboeware module provides middleware and other components for
popular web frameworks such as Django, Tornado, Pylons, and WSGI.

Running the Tests
=====================================================

The instrumentation uses tox to test against different versions of python and
instrumented modules.

The tests currently run against 2.6 and 2.7.

To set up multiple versions of python:

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python2.6 python2.6-dev

To run tests (requires `virtualenv` >= 1.11.2 and a running a
Redis <http://redis.io/> server):

    tox

Tests in test/unit are actually functional tests; naming is for historic
reasons.  Tests in test/manual are for manual verification of certain
behaviors.

MySQL SQLAlchemy tests require no-auth TCP connection (as testing user).

PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy tests requires no-auth (trust) TCP connection (as testing user).
